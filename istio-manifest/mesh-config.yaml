# Automatic protocol detection uses a set of heuristics to
# determine whether the connection is using TLS or not (on the
# server side), as well as the application protocol being used
# (e.g., http vs tcp). These heuristics rely on the client sending
# the first bits of data. For server first protocols like MySQL,
# MongoDB, etc., Envoy will timeout on the protocol detection after
# the specified period, defaulting to non mTLS plain TCP
# traffic. Set this field to tweak the period that Envoy will wait
# for the client to send the first bits of data. (MUST BE >=1ms)
